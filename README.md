# Mnkt-Renderer
## (Yet another) Implementation of a software renderer in C.

Built ***(still in progress)*** during my studies on the graphics pipeline.
Implements all the necessary stages to render graphics starting from raw vertices.

## Repository structure
The repository contains different folders, in particular:
- mnktRenderer: contains code for the core renderer, produces a static library when compiled
- imageGen: is an example project which uses the mnktRenderer to render a scene and saves it as a PPM image
